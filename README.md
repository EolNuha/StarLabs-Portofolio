# StarLabs-Portofolio
In this project there are:
 - A static folder (containing images, css and javascript files)
 - A template folder (containing html files)
 - A main.py file (this is the backend code done with Python)
 - A main.exe file (this is an executable file to run the local server, even if you don't have Python with it's dependencies installed)


To run the local server, open the main.exe file and then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the PORTOFOLIO. Hope you enjoy it :)

!WARNING, it may say that the main.exe file is a virus or a potential threat, that is because this is from an unknown source. But it's completly safe.
